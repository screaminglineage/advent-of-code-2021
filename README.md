Input data files can be downloaded from https://adventofcode.com/2021.

The files should be placed in the folder `input_data` in the project root. 
Individual files should be named `day_1.txt`, `day_1_test.txt` (for test input) and so on.

```console
input_data
├── day_1_test.txt
├── day_1.txt
├── day_2_test.txt
